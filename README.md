- 👋 Hi, I’m @vonchampz
- 👀 I’m interested in the darknet and drones. Photography and videography with drones
- 🌱 I’m currently refreshing my programming skills from UCSB where I started as pursuing a cs degree
And switched to biopsych sand pharmacology.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a webpage or sales interface that is easy for 
companies to find the right stock drone footage and license it for as many uses as they would like.
Right now those sites cost ~$400 for one use. I want to charge ~$200-$300 for unlimited use,
and it will be the best footage they can find quickly and easily.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Zach.cf@gmail.com or on here.
